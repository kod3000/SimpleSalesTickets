# Simple Sales Tickets

This app takes traditional sales ticket notebook and digitizes the functionality. It's comprised of two main components :

1) Simple Client Book - Is a system for maintaining and managing customers accounts in retail sales.

2) Simple Sales Tickets - Is a very basic system for taking ticket based orders for clients.


The app is completely web based and depends on a mobile device to be used in order to interact with the system. This made by design so that employees can just use their mobile phones to take orders or work on them on the move. Its not meant for the customer to view, however the larger more complex version of this app allows customers to view their tickets and the progress of it.


## Developer Notes 

The app is made entirely using meteorjs. I find meteor to be very powerful since it setups a client and server all in one. Meteor uses react in its core and the folder structure is the best I've seen. Its ability to integrate with other frameworks like vue.js is unmatched. 

## How to Use/Run
 

	meteor npm i

	meteor
